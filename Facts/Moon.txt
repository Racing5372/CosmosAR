One theory of the creation of the moon is that the Earth was hit be a large asteroid and started to orbit the Earth which is now known as the Moon.
The Moon pulls on the Earth's gravity which causes waves.
The word 'Lunar' comes from the Latin word for Moon which is 'Luna'.
Becuase of the way it obrbits, the Moon has a side which you cannot see from Earth. This is called the dark side of the Moon.
