Venus' atmosphere contains large quantities of greenhouse gases. This is why Venus has such a thick atmosphere. If global warming persists, Earth will look simlar to Venus.

Venus is named after the Roman Goddess of love.

It rains acid rain. However, because of the extreme temperatures on the planet's surface, the rain evaporates into water vapour.

Known as the evening and morning star

The brightest thing on the night sky except for Earth's moon
